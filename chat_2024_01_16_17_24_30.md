1. **You**: background-image: url(\Purple\Illustrated\Mountain\Desktop\Wallpaper.png) no-repeat; why this code not running
2. **ChatGPT**: The code you provided seems to have backslashes (\) in the URL path for the background image. This is likely causing the code to fail because backslashes are often used as escape characters in programming languages.

To fix this issue, you should replace the backslashes with regular forward slashes (/) or use double backslashes (\\) to escape the backslashes. Here are two corrected versions of the code:

Option 1: Using forward slashes:
```
background-image: url("/Purple/Illustrated/Mountain/Desktop/Wallpaper.png") no-repeat;
```

Option 2: Using double backslashes:
```
background-image: url("\\Purple\\Illustrated\\Mountain\\Desktop\\Wallpaper.png") no-repeat;
```

By using either of these versions, the code should run correctly and display the specified image as the background of an element.
